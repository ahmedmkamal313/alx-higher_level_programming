_Working on this repository helped me understand why Python programming is awesome and how to use its features to write simple and elegant code.
I completed several tasks that involved writing Python scripts and answering questions that demonstrate the concepts and skills I learned.
I also followed the coding style standards and made sure that my files are executable and have a proper shebang line or compilation flags._

### List of repository's content:

- **0x00-python-hello_world:**
  - Python - Python Basics
  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python programming, such as its history, creator, name origin, philosophy, interpreter, print function, strings, indexing, slicing, and coding style. I also learned how to use pycodestyle to check my code quality and how to write simple shell and C scripts.

- **0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions:**
  - Python -  Control Structures and Functions. 
  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python control structures and functions, how to use indentation, comments, variables, arithmetic operators, if, if ... else, while and for loops, break, continue, pass, range, return, and scope of variables. I also learned how to handle errors and tracebacks.
      
- **0x02-python-import_modules:**
  - Python - Modules, Packages, and Command Line Arguments.
  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python modules and packages, how to import and use functions from other files, how to create my own modules, how to use the built-in function dir(), how to prevent code from being executed when imported, and how to use command line arguments with my Python programs.

- **0x03-python-data_structures:**
  - Python - Lists, Tuples, and Sequence Data Types.
  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python lists and tuples, how to use them as sequence data types, and how to manipulate them with various methods and operators. I also learned about the differences and similarities between strings and lists, how to use lists as stacks and queues, how to create list comprehensions, what is tuple packing and unpacking, and what is the del statement.

- **0x04-python-more_data_structures:**
  - Python - Sets, Dictionaries, and Functional Programming.
  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python sets and dictionaries, how to use them as data structures, and how to perform operations on them with various methods and functions. I also learned about the differences and similarities between lists and sets, how to use sets for mathematical calculations, how to create dictionary comprehensions, what is a key-value pair, and what is the get method. Additionally, I learned about the concepts of functional programming, such as lambda functions, map, reduce, and filter functions, and how to use them to create simple and elegant expressions.

- **0x05-python-exceptions:**
  - Python - Exceptions.
  - In this project, I learned about the concept of exceptions in Python and how to use them effectively. Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. They can be caused by various errors, such as syntax errors, type errors, division by zero, or invalid input. Exceptions can be handled using the try-except-finally statements, which allow us to catch and respond to different types of errors, or perform some clean-up actions after an exception. Exceptions can also be raised using the raise keyword, which allows us to create our own errors or signal some abnormal conditions.
