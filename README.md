_Working on this repository helped me understand why Python programming is awesome and how to use its features to write simple and elegant code.
I completed several tasks that involved writing Python scripts and answering questions that demonstrate the concepts and skills I learned.
I also followed the coding style standards and made sure that my files are executable and have a proper shebang line or compilation flags._

  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python control structures and functions, how to use indentation, comments, variables, arithmetic operators, if, if ... else, while and for loops, break, continue, pass, range, return, and scope of variables. I also learned how to handle errors and tracebacks.
      
- **0x02-python-import_modules:**
  - Python - Modules, Packages, and Command Line Arguments.
  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python modules and packages, how to import and use functions from other files, how to create my own modules, how to use the built-in function dir(), how to prevent code from being executed when imported, and how to use command line arguments with my Python programs.

- **0x03-python-data_structures:**
  - Python - Lists, Tuples, and Sequence Data Types.
  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python lists and tuples, how to use them as sequence data types, and how to manipulate them with various methods and operators. I also learned about the differences and similarities between strings and lists, how to use lists as stacks and queues, how to create list comprehensions, what is tuple packing and unpacking, and what is the del statement.

- **0x04-python-more_data_structures:**
  - Python - Sets, Dictionaries, and Functional Programming.
  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python sets and dictionaries, how to use them as data structures, and how to perform operations on them with various methods and functions. I also learned about the differences and similarities between lists and sets, how to use sets for mathematical calculations, how to create dictionary comprehensions, what is a key-value pair, and what is the get method. Additionally, I learned about the concepts of functional programming, such as lambda functions, map, reduce, and filter functions, and how to use them to create simple and elegant expressions.

- **0x05-python-exceptions:**
  - Python - Exceptions.
  - In this project, I learned about the concept of exceptions in Python and how to use them effectively. Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. They can be caused by various errors, such as syntax errors, type errors, division by zero, or invalid input. Exceptions can be handled using the try-except-finally statements, which allow us to catch and respond to different types of errors, or perform some clean-up actions after an exception. Exceptions can also be raised using the raise keyword, which allows us to create our own errors or signal some abnormal conditions.

- **0x06-python-classes:**
  - Python - Classes and Objects.
  - In this project, I learned how to use OOP in Python to define my own types of objects, called classes, and create instances of them, called objects. I learned how to set and access the attributes and methods of the objects, how to control their visibility and behavior using properties, and how to dynamically add new attributes to them. I also learned how Python treats everything as an object and how it finds the attributes of an object or class using its **dict** attribute or the getattr function.

- **0x07-python-test_driven_development:**

  ![test](https://wp.klientboost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2018-04-02-at-12.30.14-PM.png)
  - Python - Test-driven development
  - In this project, I learned how to use test-driven development (TDD) in Python. TDD is a software development process that involves writing tests before writing the actual code. This way, the code can be verified to meet the requirements and avoid bugs. I learned how to write docstrings to create tests using the doctest module, which allows testing interactive Python examples. I also learned how to use the unittest module, which provides a framework for creating and running tests. I learned how to write documentation for each module and function, following the PEP 8 style guide. I learned how to use the basic option flags to create tests, such as -v for verbose mode, -m for matching patterns, and -f for fail-fast mode. I learned how to find edge cases, which are scenarios that are not typical or expected, but can cause errors or unexpected behavior.

- **0x08-python-more_classes:**
  - Python - More Classes and Objects
  - In this project, I learned about the concept of classes and objects in Python and how to use them to implement object-oriented programming (OOP). I learned about the difference between class and instance attributes, and how to define and access them. I learned about the special methods init, str, and repr, and how they are used to initialize, represent, and print objects. I learned about the concepts of data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding, and how to use properties, getters, and setters to control the access and modification of attributes. I learned about the difference between class methods and static methods, and how to use the @classmethod and @staticmethod decorators to define them. I learned how to dynamically create new attributes for existing instances using the setattr function or the dict attribute. I learned how Python finds the attributes of an object or class using the dot notation or the getattr function. This project helped me to understand the principles of OOP and how to apply them in Python.

- **0x09-python-everything_is_object:**
  - Python - Everything is object.
  - In this project, I learned about the concept of objects in Python and how they are different from classes and instances. I also learned about the difference between immutable and mutable objects, and how they affect the way variables are assigned, referenced, and aliased. I learned how to use the id() function to check the identity and memory address of an object, and how to compare two variables using the is and == operators. I learned about the built-in mutable and immutable types in Python, such as lists, tuples, strings, and numbers. Finally, I learned how Python passes variables to functions by reference or by value, depending on the mutability of the object. This project helped me to understand the underlying mechanisms of Pythonâ€™s object model and how to work with different types of objects in a consistent and efficient way.

- **0x0A-python-inheritance:**
  - Python - Inheritance
  - I learned from this project how to create new classes from existing ones using inheritance, how to list and add attributes and methods to classes and instances, how to inherit from multiple classes and use the object class as the default superclass, how to override and access inherited attributes and methods, and how to use built-in functions to check and manipulate class relationships.

- **0x0B-python-input_output:**
  - Python - Input/Output
  -  This project is about learning how to read and write files in Python, as well as how to manipulate data using JSON format. The main topics covered are:
    - How to open and close files using the `open` and `close` functions, or the `with`statement
    - How to read and write text files using the `read`, `write`, and `append` methods
    - How to use the `try-except` block to handle errors and exceptions
    - How to use the `os` module to check if a file exists or delete a file
    - How to use the `json` module to convert Python objects to JSON strings, and vice versa
    - How to create and use custom classes with JSON serialization and deserialization

- **0x0C-python-almost_a_circle:**
  - Python - Almost a Circle
  - This project is about learning how to use classes, inheritance, and abstraction in Python. It also covers how to use the `unittest` module to write and run tests, and how to handle arguments and serialization with JSON

  - SQL - Introduction
  - This project is about learning the basics of SQL and relational databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is a standard language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases1. Relational databases are systems that organize data into tables, rows, and columns, and use primary keys and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables
