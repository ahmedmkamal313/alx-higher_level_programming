_Working on this repository helped me understand why Python programming is awesome and how to use its features to write simple and elegant code.
I completed several tasks that involved writing Python scripts and answering questions that demonstrate the concepts and skills I learned.
I also followed the coding style standards and made sure that my files are executable and have a proper shebang line or compilation flags._

### List of repository's content:

- **0x00-python-hello_world:**
  - Python - Python Basics
  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python programming, such as its history, creator, name origin, philosophy, interpreter, print function, strings, indexing, slicing, and coding style. I also learned how to use pycodestyle to check my code quality and how to write simple shell and C scripts.

- **0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions:**
  - Python -  Control Structures and Functions. 
  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python control structures and functions, how to use indentation, comments, variables, arithmetic operators, if, if ... else, while and for loops, break, continue, pass, range, return, and scope of variables. I also learned how to handle errors and tracebacks.
      
- **0x02-python-import_modules:**
  - Python - Modules, Packages, and Command Line Arguments.
  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python modules and packages, how to import and use functions from other files, how to create my own modules, how to use the built-in function dir(), how to prevent code from being executed when imported, and how to use command line arguments with my Python programs.

- **0x03-python-data_structures:**
  - Python - Lists, Tuples, and Sequence Data Types.
  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python lists and tuples, how to use them as sequence data types, and how to manipulate them with various methods and operators. I also learned about the differences and similarities between strings and lists, how to use lists as stacks and queues, how to create list comprehensions, what is tuple packing and unpacking, and what is the del statement.

- **0x04-python-more_data_structures:**
  - Python - Sets, Dictionaries, and Functional Programming.
  - In this project, I learned about the basics of Python sets and dictionaries, how to use them as data structures, and how to perform operations on them with various methods and functions. I also learned about the differences and similarities between lists and sets, how to use sets for mathematical calculations, how to create dictionary comprehensions, what is a key-value pair, and what is the get method. Additionally, I learned about the concepts of functional programming, such as lambda functions, map, reduce, and filter functions, and how to use them to create simple and elegant expressions.

- **0x05-python-exceptions:**
  - Python - Exceptions.
  - In this project, I learned about the concept of exceptions in Python and how to use them effectively. Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. They can be caused by various errors, such as syntax errors, type errors, division by zero, or invalid input. Exceptions can be handled using the try-except-finally statements, which allow us to catch and respond to different types of errors, or perform some clean-up actions after an exception. Exceptions can also be raised using the raise keyword, which allows us to create our own errors or signal some abnormal conditions.

- **0x06-python-classes:**
  - Python - Classes and Objects.
  - In this project, I learned how to use OOP in Python to define my own types of objects, called classes, and create instances of them, called objects. I learned how to set and access the attributes and methods of the objects, how to control their visibility and behavior using properties, and how to dynamically add new attributes to them. I also learned how Python treats everything as an object and how it finds the attributes of an object or class using its **dict** attribute or the getattr function.

- **0x08-python-more_classes:**
  - Python - More Classes and Objects
  - In this project, I learned about the concept of classes and objects in Python and how to use them to implement object-oriented programming (OOP). I learned about the difference between class and instance attributes, and how to define and access them. I learned about the special methods init, str, and repr, and how they are used to initialize, represent, and print objects. I learned about the concepts of data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding, and how to use properties, getters, and setters to control the access and modification of attributes. I learned about the difference between class methods and static methods, and how to use the @classmethod and @staticmethod decorators to define them. I learned how to dynamically create new attributes for existing instances using the setattr function or the dict attribute. I learned how Python finds the attributes of an object or class using the dot notation or the getattr function. This project helped me to understand the principles of OOP and how to apply them in Python.

- **0x09-python-everything_is_object:**
  - Python - Everything is object.
  - In this project, I learned about the concept of objects in Python and how they are different from classes and instances. I also learned about the difference between immutable and mutable objects, and how they affect the way variables are assigned, referenced, and aliased. I learned how to use the id() function to check the identity and memory address of an object, and how to compare two variables using the is and == operators. I learned about the built-in mutable and immutable types in Python, such as lists, tuples, strings, and numbers. Finally, I learned how Python passes variables to functions by reference or by value, depending on the mutability of the object. This project helped me to understand the underlying mechanisms of Pythonâ€™s object model and how to work with different types of objects in a consistent and efficient way.
