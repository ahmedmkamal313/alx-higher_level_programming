# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

![python](https://www.bing.com/images/blob?bcid=qGH0uuDICMQFOX4iNdg4Q6O4MF1b.....10)

This project is about learning the basics of **object-oriented programming** (OOP) in Python. OOP is a paradigm that allows us to define and manipulate data structures as objects, which have attributes and methods. Objects can also interact with each other through inheritance, composition, and polymorphism.


### Requirements
- Python 3.4 or higher
- PEP 8 style
### Files
The following files are part of this project:

- `0-square.py`: A class Square that defines a square by its size
- `1-square.py`: A class Square that defines a square by its size and validates it
- `2-square.py`: A class Square that defines a square by its size and handles errors
- `3-square.py`: A class Square that defines a square by its size and has a method to calculate its area
- `4-square.py`: A class Square that defines a square by its size and has a getter and setter for it
- `5-square.py`: A class Square that defines a square by its size and has a method to print it
- `6-square.py`: A class Square that defines a square by its size and position and has a method to print it

### Usage
To use these files, you can import them as modules in your Python code or run them as scripts. For example:
```
>>> from 4-square import Square
>>> s = Square(5)
>>> s.size
5
>>> s.size = 10
>>> s.size
10
>>> s.area()
100
```
