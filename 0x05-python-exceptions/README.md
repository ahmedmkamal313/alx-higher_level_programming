# 0x05. Python - Exceptions
This is a Python project that covers the topic of exceptions. Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions.

### Requirements:
- **General:**
    - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
    - All the files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
    - The first line of all the files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
    - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    - The code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
    - All the files must be executable
    - The length of the files will be tested using `wc`

### Installation:
To use this project, you need to clone this repository and run the files with python3.
```
git clone https://github.com/ahmedmkamal/alx-higher_level_programming.git
cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x05-python-exceptions
python3 file_name.py
```
### Usage
This project contains several files that demonstrate different concepts of exceptions in Python. Each file has a main function that tests the code. Here is a brief description of each file:

- `0-safe_print_list.py`: A function that prints x elements of a list.
- `1-safe_print_integer.py`: A function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().
- `2-safe_print_list_integers.py`: A function that prints the first x elements of a list that are integers.
- `3-safe_print_division.py`: A function that divides two integers and prints the result.
- `4-list_division.py`: A function that divides element by element two lists.
- `5-raise_exception.py`: A function that raises a type exception.
- `6-raise_exception_msg.py`: A function that raises a name exception with a message.
